            <li>The browser makes a request to a product information page</li>
            <li>
              The server receives a request, downloads the necessary product
              data from another server, generates HTML based on the received
              data and the currently required React components.
            </li>
            <li>
              The browser immediately receives HTML with the necessary
              information, but the JS has not yet been loaded.
            </li>
            <li>
              JS is loaded after that in the background, this process is called
              hydration
            </li>

          <h2>In React.js</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>The browser makes a request to a product information page</li>
            <li>
              The server returns a minimal HTML file that specifies the import
              of a JS file using React.
            </li>
            <li>Once the HTML is loaded, the JS is loaded.</li>
            <li>
              Only after the JS file is loaded, the necessary DOM elements are
              created, data is loaded from the server, and useful content is
              displayed.

        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Pros of Next.js</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When using Next.js, the browser immediately receives the finished
              HTML with the necessary information, without waiting for the JS to
              load.
            </li>
            <li>Next.js makes requests to external APIs on the server side.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Cons of Next.js</h2>
          <li>
            Next.js loads the JS after the HTML, until then the page will remain
            non-interactive. But even so, Next.js will load the minimum required
            JS first, and then the rest.
          </li>
          <li>
            More server resources are needed because Next.js renders the HTML on
            the server side before sending it to the client.
          </li>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>NEXT.JS ARCHITECTURE</h2>
          <p>
            You can create a new application on Next.js using a ready-made
            toolkit: <i>npx create-next-app my-app</i> Next.js supports eslint and CSS
            modules out of the box. Static files can be placed in the public
            folder, just like in regular React. But the most important folder
            for us is pages.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>HOW NEXT.JS GENERATES ACCESSIBLE URLS AND OPTIMIZES PAGES</h2>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>
            Each file inside this folder (except api folder, _app and _document)
            is treated by Next.js as a separate page. This is how Next.js automatically converts the file
            structure to a URL, including dynamic parameters.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>
            Next.js gives us two options that lead to different results. Both
            options work as named exports:
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>getServerSideProps</p>
          <p>
            will be called on every request while the application is running.
            Inside, you can make calls to external services and APIs to get the
            latest up-to-date information. Depending on whether a person is
            visiting the site for the first time or simply moving between pages,
            this call will be made either on the server or on the client.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>getStaticProps</p>
          <p>
            will be called once when building the application, it will prepare
            the finished HTML files. Let's say you have a list of articles that
            are rarely updated. They can be pre-rendered with getStaticProps and
            these pages will load faster since they already have all the
            information. Both functions need to be exported with this named
            export so that Next.js can see and use them.
          </p>

            Next.js provides features and components that are needed for
            specific use cases.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>next/router</b> is a module for working with the Next.js
              router. Programmatic redirects, getting data from a URL on the
              client.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>next/link</b> component that renders the "correct" links. They
              will be regular a tags and will work even if the user has JS
              disabled. If JS is enabled, a transition will occur on click using
              client-side rendering and Next.js optimizations.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>next/head</b> is a component that allows you to change the
              content of the head tag without regard to the server/client
              render.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>next/script</b> - Script component for connecting external
              scripts on the client (for example, metrics).
            </li>
